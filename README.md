# node-thermoxl

## Plan
Starting on 2015-01-24 I will try to create a node application / webserver which can act as a (smart) thermastat on a raspberry pi. 

* Easy web interface to show data and control thermostat
* Control relay via GPIO
* Read temprature and humidity from sensor via GPIO

## Hardware

* Raspberry Pi Model B+
