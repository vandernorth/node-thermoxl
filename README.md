## Plan
The plan has changed (multiple times). The newest plan:

* Two 'apps'
  * P1 Reader which sends usage to web
  * Web Api and dashboard where we can see the usage
* If allowed we should be able to send usage to NEST via nest-api

## Hardware

* Raspberry Pi Model B+
* Some virtual server somewhere (could use the Pi as well)
